# Data Services (Azure)
- Data services are cloud-based services that provide various functionalities for managing, processing, and analyzing data. They offer scalable and flexible solutions for data storage, data integration, data processing, and data analytics.

## Azure SQL
- Azure SQL is the collective name for a family of relational database solutions based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. It includes:
  - `Azure SQL Database`: A fully managed relational database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security. It is designed for modern cloud applications and offers built-in intelligence to optimize performance and security.
  - `Azure SQL Managed Instance`: A fully managed instance of SQL Server that provides near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server on-premises (Enterprise Edition) database engine. It is ideal for migrating existing applications to the cloud without changing the application code.
  - `Azure SQL VM`: A virtual machine that runs SQL Server. It provides full control over the SQL Server instance and is suitable for applications that require specific configurations or have dependencies on certain features of SQL Server.

## Open-source databases in Azure
- Azure also supports a variety of open-source databases, including:
  - `Azure Database for MySQL`: A fully managed MySQL database service that provides high availability, security, and scalability. It is designed for applications that require a MySQL database and offers built-in intelligence to optimize performance and security.
  - `Azure Database for PostgreSQL`: A fully managed PostgreSQL database service that provides high availability, security, and scalability. It is designed for applications that require a PostgreSQL database and offers built-in intelligence to optimize performance and security.
  - `Azure Database for MariaDB`: A fully managed MariaDB database service that provides high availability, security, and scalability. It is designed for applications that require a MariaDB database and offers built-in intelligence to optimize performance and security.

## Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides high availability, low latency, and elastic scalability. 
- It supports multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family data models. 
- It is designed for applications that require high throughput and low latency at a global scale.

## Azure Storage
- Azure Storage is a cloud-based storage solution that provides scalable and secure storage for various types of data, including:
  - `blobs`: Object storage for unstructured data.
  - `files`: File shares that are accessible via the SMB protocol.
  - `queues`: Message queuing for reliable communication between applications.
  - `tables`: NoSQL key-value store for storing structured data.

## Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate data pipelines.
- You can integrate your pipelines with other Azure services, enabling you to ingest data from cloud data stores, process the data using cloud-based compute, and persist the results in another data store.

## Microsoft Fabric
- Microsoft Fabric is a unified analytics platform that brings together data engineering, data warehousing, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence into a single, integrated experience. Supports:
  - `Data ingestion and ETL`
  - `Data lakehouse analytics`
  - `Data warehouse analytics`
  - `Data Science and machine learning`
  - `Realtime analytics`
  - `Data visualization`
  - `Data governance and management`
  - `AI-powered insights`

## Azure Databricks
- Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform that provides a collaborative environment for data engineering, data science, and machine learning. It offers:
  - `Data engineering`: Build and manage data pipelines to ingest, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
  - `Data science`: Develop and deploy machine learning models using popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
  - `Real-time analytics`: Process streaming data in real-time to gain insights and make informed decisions.

## Azure Stream Analytics
- Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics service that allows you to process and analyze streaming data from various sources, such as IoT devices, applications, and social media. It provides:
  - `Real-time analytics`: Process streaming data in real-time to gain insights and make informed decisions.
  - `Integration with Azure services`: Integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Data Lake Storage, to create end-to-end streaming solutions.

## Azure Data Explorer
- Azure Data Explorer is a fully managed, standalone, big data analytics platform that offers high-performance querying of log and telemetry data. It provides:
  - `Data exploration`: Explore and analyze large volumes of data using a powerful query language.
  - `Integration with Azure services`: Integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure Data Lake Storage, to create end-to-end data exploration solutions.

## Microsoft Purview
- Microsoft Purview is a dedicated unified data governance service. Its exact purpose is to map, classify, and ensure the discoverability and integrity of data across your entire organization, whether that data lives on-premises, in Azure, or in other clouds. It provides:
  - `Data cataloging`: Automatically discover and catalog data assets across the organization.
  - `Data lineage`: Track the lineage of data as it flows through various systems and processes.
  - `Data classification`: Classify data based on sensitivity and apply appropriate security controls.
  - `Data governance policies`: Define and enforce data governance policies to ensure compliance with regulations and standards.
