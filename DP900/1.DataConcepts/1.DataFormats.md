# What is Data?
- Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.

# Data Formats
- Data can be stored in various formats, including:
  - `Structured data`
  - `Semi-structured data`
  - `Unstructured data`

## Structured Data
- It has a predefined and fixed schema, often organized in tables - having rows and columns (e.g., SQL databases).
- The tables can relate to each other through keys.

## Semi-Structured Data
- Does not have a strict format but still contains tags or markers to separate data elements (e.g., JSON, XML).
- They allow some variation in the data model.

## Unstructured Data
- Lacks a predefined format, making it more challenging to analyze (e.g., documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files).
