# Databases
## What is a Database?
- A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
- Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which provide tools for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## Types of Databases
- There are several types of databases, including:
  - `Relational Databases`
  - `NoSQL Databases`
  - `In-Memory Databases`
  - `NewSQL Databases`

### Relational Databases
- Relational databases store data in tables that represent entities and their relationships.
- Each table has a predefined schema, and relationships are established through primary and foreign keys.
- They can be normalized (removing redundancy) to improve data integrity.
- They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and retrieval.


### NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL databases are designed for unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible schemas.
- Four main types of NoSQL databases are:
  - Key-value stores (e.g., Redis)
  - Document databases - each document is a JSON object (e.g., MongoDB)
  - Column-family stores. You can divide the columns into families. Each family contains a set of logical related columns (e.g., Cassandra)
  - Graph databases - nodes with links (e.g., Neo4j)

### In-Memory Databases
- In-memory databases store data in the main memory (RAM) for faster access and processing.
- They are used in applications requiring low-latency data access, such as caching and real-time analytics.
- Examples include Redis and Memcached.

### NewSQL Databases
- NewSQL databases combine the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID guarantees of traditional relational databases.
- They are designed to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining data integrity.
- Examples include Google Spanner and CockroachDB.
