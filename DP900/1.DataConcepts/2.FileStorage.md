# File Storage
- File storage is a method of storing data in a hierarchical structure, typically using a file system.
- The file format depends on:
  - The type of data being stored (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).
  - The applications and services that will need to read, write, and process the data.
  - The need for the data files to be readable by humans, or optimized for efficient storage and processing.

## Delimited Text Files
- Delimited text files use a specific character (often a comma or tab) to separate values within a record.
- `CSV (Comma-Separated Values)` is a common type of delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values.

```csv
name,age,city // Optional header
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
```
- `TSV (Tab-Separated Values)` is another type of delimited text file that uses a tab character to separate values.
```tsv
name	age	city
Alice	30	New York
Bob	25	Los Angeles
Charlie	35	Chicago
```

## JSON
- `JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write.
  - `{}` represents an empty JSON object.
  - `[]` represents an empty JSON array.
  - `:` is used to separate keys and values within an object.
  - `,` is used to separate key-value pairs within an object or elements within an array.
```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "age": 25,
      "city": "Los Angeles"
    },
    {
      "name": "Charlie",
      "age": 35,
      "city": "Chicago"
    }
  ]
}
```

## XML
- `XML (eXtensible Markup Language)` is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
```xml
<employees>
  <employee>
    <name>Alice</name>
    <age>30</age>
    <city>New York</city>
  </employee>
  <employee>
    <name>Bob</name>
    <age>25</age>
    <city>Los Angeles</city>
  </employee>
</employees>
```

## BLOBs
- `BLOB (Binary Large Object)` is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system.
- BLOBs are typically used to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, audio files, and multimedia objects.

## Optimized Storage Formats
- Optimized storage formats are designed to improve the efficiency of data storage and retrieval.
- These formats often use compression, encoding, or other techniques to reduce the size of the data and improve performance.
- Examples of optimized storage formats include:
  - `Parquet`: A columnar storage format that is optimized for use with big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop. It supports very efficient compression and encoding schemes.
  - `ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)`: Another columnar storage format that is optimized for use with the Apache Hive data warehouse.
  - `Avro`: A row-based storage format that is optimized for use with data serialization and deserialization. It is good for compressing data and minimizing storage and network bandwidth requirements.
