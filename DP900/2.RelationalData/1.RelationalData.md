# Relational Data
- Relational data is a type of data that is organized into tables (or relations) that are linked to each other through common attributes. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining, manipulating, and querying the data.
- Key characteristics of relational data include:
  - **Structured Format**: Data is organized into tables with a predefined schema, making it easy to understand and work with.
  - **Relationships**: Tables can be related to one another through foreign keys, allowing for complex queries and data integrity.
  - **ACID Compliance**: Relational databases typically adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.

## Base concepts
- **Table**: A collection of related data entries that consists of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity, such as customers or orders.
- **Row**: A single record in a table, representing a unique instance of the entity. Each row contains values for each column in the table.
- **Column**: A specific attribute of the entity represented by the table. Each column has a defined data type, such as integer, varchar, or date.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value for the primary key column(s).
- **Foreign Key**: A column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.
- **Null**: A special marker used to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database. Null is different from an empty string or a zero value; it represents the absence of a value.

## Normalization
- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.
- Purposes:
  - Separate each `entity` into its own table.
  - Separate each discrete `attribute` into its own column.
  - Uniquely identify each entity instance (row) using a `primary key`.
  - Use `foreign key` columns to link related entities.
- Normalization is typically achieved through a series of steps called normal forms, each with specific rules and requirements. The most commonly used normal forms are:
  - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values and that each row is unique.
    - Ex: A table of customer orders should not contain multiple items in a single order column; instead, each item should have its own row.
  - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Builds on 1NF by ensuring that all non-key columns are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
    - Ex: In a table of customer orders, if the order details (e.g., product name, quantity) depend only on the order ID and not on the customer ID, then the table is in 2NF.
  - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Builds on 2NF by ensuring that all non-key columns are not only fully functionally dependent on the primary key but also independent of each other.
    - Ex: In a table of customer orders, if the customer information (e.g., name, address) is stored alongside the order details, it should be moved to a separate table to eliminate redundancy.
  - **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A stronger version of 3NF that addresses certain types of anomalies not covered by 3NF. In BCNF, for every functional dependency (X → Y), X must be a superkey.
