# SQL 
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
- Some popular dialects of SQL include:
  - **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**: This version of SQL is used by Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL services.
  - **pgSQL**: This is the dialect, with extensions implemented in PostgreSQL.
  - **PL/SQL**: This is the dialect used by Oracle. PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language/SQL.
- SQL Statement types:
  - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used to define and modify database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements).
  - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used to control access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE statements).
  - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used to insert, update, and delete data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements).

## DDL Statements
- **CREATE**: Used to create new database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes).
  - `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);`
  - `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
  - `CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);`
- **ALTER**: Used to modify existing database objects (e.g., adding or dropping columns in a table).
- **DROP**: Used to delete database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes).
- **RENAME**: Used to rename database objects (e.g., tables, columns).

## DCL Statements
- **GRANT**: Used to give users access privileges to database objects.
- **DENY**: Used to explicitly deny users access privileges to database objects.
- **REVOKE**: Used to remove access privileges from users.

## DML Statements
- **SELECT**: Used to query and retrieve data from a table.
- **INSERT**: Used to add new records to a table.
- **UPDATE**: Used to modify existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Used to remove records from a table.

## Clauses
- **WHERE**: Used to filter records based on specified conditions.
- **ORDER BY**: Used to sort the result set by one or more columns.
- **GROUP BY**: Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
- **HAVING**: Used to filter groups based on specified conditions.

## Aggregate Functions
- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.
- **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
- **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
- **MIN()**: Returns the smallest value in a set.
- **MAX()**: Returns the largest value in a set.
- **BETWEEN**: Used to filter the result set within a certain range (e.g., BETWEEN value1 AND value2).
- **DISTINCT**: Used to return only unique values from a column (e.g., SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name).
- **LIKE**: Used to search for a specified pattern in a column (e.g., WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern%').

## JOIN Types
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table records. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for non-matching columns.
- **CROSS JOIN**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, combining each row from the first table with all rows from the second table.
