# Azure SQL Database
- Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service provided by Microsoft Azure.

## Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is a feature of Azure SQL Database that helps protect your data at rest.
- TDE helps protect against unauthorized access to the physical files of the database and is enabled by default for all new Azure SQL Databases.

## Server-level firewall rules
- Server-level firewall rules are used to control access to your Azure SQL Database server.
- You can create firewall rules to allow or deny access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
- By default, all incoming traffic is blocked, and you must explicitly allow access for your application or users.
- You can allow access to Azure services by creating a firewall rule that includes the Azure service's IP address or range.

## Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Azure SQL Managed Instance is a fully managed database service that provides the best of both worlds: the rich SQL Server surface area and the benefits of a fully managed service.
- It is designed for customers who want to lift and shift their on-premises SQL Server workloads to Azure with minimal changes.
- Key features include:
  - **Instance-level features**: Azure SQL Managed Instance supports a wide range of SQL Server features, including SQL Server Agent, cross-database queries, and more.
  - **Built-in high availability**: Azure SQL Managed Instance provides built-in high availability with automatic failover and backup capabilities.
  - **Security**: Azure SQL Managed Instance offers advanced security features, including network isolation, encryption, and threat detection.
- So there are 3 options:
  - `Azure SQL Database`: A fully managed database service for modern cloud applications, but it doesn't support all SQL Server features.
  - `Azure SQL Managed Instance`: A fully managed database service that provides the best of both worlds: the rich SQL Server surface area and the benefits of a fully managed service, while still supporting all SQL Server features.
  - `SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines`: A fully managed SQL Server instance hosted on Azure VMs, providing complete control over the SQL Server instance and the underlying operating system.

## Serverless Compute Tier
- The Serverless compute tier is a flexible option for Azure SQL Database that automatically scales compute resources based on workload demand.
- Key features include:
  - **Automatic scaling**: The Serverless tier automatically scales compute resources up or down based on the workload, allowing you to pay only for the resources you use.
  - **Pause and resume**: You can pause the database during periods of inactivity, and it will automatically resume when needed.
  - **Cost-effective**: The Serverless tier is designed for workloads with variable or unpredictable usage patterns, making it a cost-effective option for many applications.
