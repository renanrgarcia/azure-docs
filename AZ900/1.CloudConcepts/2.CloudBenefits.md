# Cloud Benefits
## High Availability
- Ensures that applications and services are always accessible, even in the event of hardware failures or other disruptions.
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: A commitment between a service provider and a customer that outlines the expected level of service, including uptime guarantees and performance metrics.
  - **Example**: An SLA might guarantee 99.9% uptime for a cloud service, meaning the service is expected to be unavailable for no more than 8.76 hours per year.

## Scalability
- The ability to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to a pool of resources.

## Reliability
- The ability of a system to consistently perform its intended functions without failure.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The capability to continue operating properly in the event of a failure of some of its components.

## Predictability
- The ability to anticipate and plan for future resource needs based on historical usage patterns and trends.
- **Performance**: The ability to maintain consistent and reliable performance levels, even during peak usage times.
- **Cost Management**: The ability to monitor and control cloud spending, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and cost-effectively.

## Security
- The protection of cloud resources and data from unauthorized access, breaches, and other threats.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Tools and processes for managing user identities and their access to cloud resources.

## Cloud management
- The process of overseeing and controlling cloud resources and services to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.
