# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code and automation. Key benefits include:
  - **Consistency**: Ensure consistent environments by using code to define infrastructure.
  - **Version Control**: Track changes to infrastructure over time using version control systems.
  - **Automation**: Automate the deployment and management of infrastructure, reducing manual effort and errors.
- Common IaC tools for Azure include:
  - **ARM Templates**: JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for Azure solutions.
  - **Terraform**: An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
  - **Bicep**: A domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources, offering a simpler syntax than JSON.

## Azure ARM
- Azure ARM (Azure Resource Manager) is the deployment and management service for Azure. Key features include:
  - **Resource Grouping**: Organize and manage related resources as a group.
  - **Declarative Templates**: Use JSON templates to define and deploy infrastructure as code.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Control access to resources at a granular level.

### ARM Templates
- ARM templates are JSON files that define the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure solutions. Key features include:
  - **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure using code, enabling version control and automation.
  - **Declarative Syntax**: Specify what resources you want to deploy without having to write the sequence of actions to create them.
  - **Reusable Components**: Create modular templates that can be reused across different projects and environments.

## Azure Bicep
- Azure Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. Key features include:
  - **Simplified Syntax**: Bicep offers a more concise and readable syntax compared to JSON.
  - **Modularization**: Easily create reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns.
  - **Integration with ARM**: Bicep transpiles to ARM templates, allowing you to leverage existing ARM capabilities.

## Terraform
- Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Key features include:
  - **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.
  - **Execution Plans**: Generate and review execution plans before applying changes.
  - **Resource Graph**: Understand resource dependencies and visualize your infrastructure.
