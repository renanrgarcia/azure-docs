# Azure Resource Locks
- Azure Resource Locks help you prevent accidental deletion or modification of critical resources. You can apply locks at different levels, including:
  - **Resource Level**: Apply a lock to a specific resource.
  - **Resource Group Level**: Apply a lock to all resources within a resource group.
  - **Subscription Level**: Apply a lock to all resources within a subscription.

## Lock Types
- **Read-Only Lock**: Prevents changes to a resource, but allows read operations.
- **Delete Lock**: Prevents a resource from being deleted.

## Best Practices
- Use resource locks to protect critical resources from accidental changes.
- Combine resource locks with Azure Policy for enhanced governance and compliance.
