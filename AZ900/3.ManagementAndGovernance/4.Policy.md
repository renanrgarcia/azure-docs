- Can be set at levels: **Management Group**, **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, and **Resource**.

## Key Features
- **Policy Definitions**: Define policies using JSON to specify the rules and effects for resource properties.
- **Initiatives**: Group multiple policy definitions into a single initiative for easier management and assignment.
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor the compliance status of your resources against assigned policies.

## Initiatives
