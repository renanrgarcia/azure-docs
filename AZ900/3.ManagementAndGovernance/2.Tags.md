# Resource Tags
- Resource tags are key-value pairs that help you organize and manage your Azure resources. They can be used for:
  - **Cost management**: Track and allocate costs to specific projects, departments, or environments.
  - **Automation**: Use tags to identify resources for automated processes, such as backups or scaling.
  - **Governance**: Enforce policies and compliance requirements based on resource tags.
- Tags cannot be inherited from resource groups or subscriptions to individual resources, or vice versa.

## Best Practices for Using Tags
- Develop a consistent tagging strategy that aligns with your organization's goals.
- Use a limited set of standardized tags to avoid confusion and ensure consistency.
- Regularly review and update tags to reflect changes in your organization or projects.
