# Microsoft Entra ID
- **Description**: Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service that helps organizations manage user identities and access to resources.

## On-premises Integration
- Microsoft Entra ID can be integrated with on-premises Active Directory (AD) to provide a unified identity solution.
- **Hybrid Identity**: Allows organizations to extend their on-premises identities to the cloud, enabling seamless access to both cloud and on-premises resources.
- **Azure AD Connect**: A tool that facilitates the synchronization of on-premises AD with Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring that user identities are consistent across both environments.

## Microsoft Entra Domain Services
- Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, and LDAP without the need for on-premises infrastructure.
- It allows organizations to extend their existing Active Directory (AD) environments to the cloud, enabling seamless access to cloud resources while maintaining compatibility with legacy applications.
- The information is synchronized between on-premises AD and Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring consistency across both environments.

## Authentication Methods
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Users must provide additional verification (e.g., a code sent to their phone) in addition to their password.
  - Something you have (e.g., a security token)
  - Something you are (e.g., a fingerprint)
  - Something you know (e.g., a security question)
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Users can authenticate without a password using methods such as biometrics or security keys.
  - `Microsoft Authenticator App`: A mobile app that provides a secure way to authenticate users without a password.
  - `Windows Hello for Business`: A feature that allows users to log in to their devices and applications using biometric authentication (e.g., facial recognition or fingerprint scanning).
  - `FIDO2 Security Keys`: Hardware devices that provide a secure way to authenticate users without a password.

## External Identity Providers
- **Business to business (B2B) collaboration** - Collaborate with external users by letting them use their preferred identity to sign-in to your Microsoft applications or other enterprise applications (SaaS apps, custom-developed apps, etc.). B2B collaboration users are represented in your directory, typically as guest users.
- **B2B direct connect** - Establish a mutual, two-way trust with another Microsoft Entra organization for seamless collaboration. B2B direct connect currently supports Teams shared channels, enabling external users to access your resources from within their home instances of Teams. B2B direct connect users aren't represented in your directory, but they're visible from within the Teams shared channel and can be monitored in Teams admin center reports.
- **Microsoft Azure Active Directory business to customer (B2C)** - Publish modern SaaS apps or custom-developed apps (excluding Microsoft apps) to consumers and customers, while using Azure AD B2C for identity and access management.

## Conditional Access
- Conditional Access policies allow you to enforce requirements for accessing your applications and data.
- Policies can be based on user location, device state, application sensitivity, and risk level.
- Common scenarios include requiring MFA for high-risk sign-ins or blocking access from untrusted networks.

## Azure RBAC
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system that provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources.
- It allows you to assign roles to users, groups, or applications at different scopes (subscription, resource group, or individual resource).
- Common built-in roles include:
  - **Owner**: Full access to all resources, including the ability to assign roles.
  - **Contributor**: Can create and manage all types of Azure resources but cannot assign roles.
  - **Reader**: Can view existing resources but cannot make changes.

## Zero Trust
- Zero Trust is a security model that assumes that threats could be internal or external and thus verifies every request as though it originates from an open network.
- Protect assets anywhere with centralized policy enforcement.
- Key principles include:
  - **Never trust, always verify**: Authenticate and authorize every request.
  - **Least privilege access**: Limit user access to only what is necessary.
  - **Micro-segmentation**: Divide the network into smaller segments to contain potential breaches.
  - **Assume breach**: Always assume that a breach has occurred or will occur, and implement measures to minimize its impact.

## Defense in Depth
- Defense in Depth is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system.
- The idea is to provide redundancy in the event that one layer fails.
- Key components include:
  - **Physical Security**: Protecting the physical infrastructure.
  - **Identity and Access**: Managing user identities and controlling access to resources.
  - **Perimeter Security**: Defending the network perimeter against external threats.
  - **Network Security**: Implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and segmentation.
  - **Compute Security**: Protecting compute resources such as virtual machines and containers.
  - **Application Security**: Ensuring that applications are secure from vulnerabilities.
  - **Data Security**: Protecting data at rest and in transit.


## Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a security management system that provides advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads.
- Key features include:
  - **Security Posture Management**: Assess and improve your security posture across Azure and on-premises environments.
  - **Threat Protection**: Detect and respond to threats in real-time using advanced analytics and machine learning.
  - **Compliance Management**: Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.
  - **Integration with Azure Services**: Seamlessly integrates with other Azure services for a unified security experience.
