# Azure Storage Accounts
- Azure Storage Accounts provide a scalable and secure way to store data in the cloud.
- `Premium Storage Accounts` are designed for high-performance workloads that require low latency and high throughput. They use solid-state drives (SSDs) to provide faster access to data compared to standard storage accounts, which use hard disk drives (HDDs).

## Redundancy options
- **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**: Replicates data three times within a single data center in the same region. This provides protection against hardware failures but does not protect against data center outages.
  - 11 9's annual durability for data stored with LRS (99.999999999% durability).
- **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**: Replicates data across three availability zones within the same region. This provides protection against data center outages and ensures high availability.
  - 12 9's annual durability for data stored with ZRS (99.9999999999% durability).
- **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**: Replicates data (one copy) to a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region. This provides protection against regional outages and ensures disaster recovery capabilities.
- **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**: Combines the benefits of ZRS and GRS by replicating data across three availability zones in the primary region and to a secondary region (three copies LRS). This provides high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- For read access to the secondary region, enable **read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)** or **read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS)**.

## Storage services
- **Azure Blobs**: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data. Also includes support for big data analytics through Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Azure Files**: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.
- **Azure Queues**: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.
- **Azure Disks**: Block-level storage volumes for Azure VMs.
- **Azure Tables**: NoSQL table option for structured, non-relational data.

### Blob storage tiers
- `Hot access tier`: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
- `Cool access tier`: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
- `Cold access tier`: Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 90 days.
- `Archive access tier`: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).

## Storage account types
- **General-purpose v2 (GPv2)**: The most common type of storage account that supports all storage services, including blobs, files, queues, and tables. It offers the latest features and performance improvements.
  - Supported redundancy options: LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS.
  - Supported services: `Blob Storage`, `File Storage`, `Queue Storage`, `Table Storage`, `Disk Storage`.
- **Premium block blobs**: A storage account type optimized for high-performance workloads that require low latency and high throughput for block blob storage.
  - Supported redundancy options: LRS, ZRS.
  - Supported services: `Block Blob Storage`.
- **Premium file shares**: A storage account type optimized for high-performance workloads that require low latency and high throughput for file shares.
  - Supported redundancy options: LRS, ZRS.
  - Supported services: `File Storage`.
- **Premium page blobs**: A storage account type optimized for high-performance workloads that require low latency and high throughput for page blob storage, typically used for virtual machine disks.
  - Supported redundancy options: LRS, ZRS.
  - Supported services: `Page Blob Storage`.

## Azure Migrate
- Azure Migrate is a service that helps you discover, assess, and migrate on-premises applications and workloads to Azure. 
- It provides tools and guidance for migrating virtual machines, databases, applications, and data to Azure, making the migration process easier and more efficient.

### Azure Migrate tools
- `Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment`: Discover and assess on-premises servers running on VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers in preparation for migration to Azure.
- `Azure Migrate: Server Migration`: Migrate VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized servers, and public cloud VMs to Azure.
- `Data Migration Assistant`: Data Migration Assistant is a stand-alone tool to assess SQL Servers. It helps pinpoint potential problems blocking migration. It identifies unsupported features, new features that can benefit you after migration, and the right path for database migration.
- `Azure Database Migration Service`: Migrate on-premises databases to Azure VMs running SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or SQL Managed Instances.
- `Azure App Service migration assistant`: Azure App Service migration assistant is a standalone tool to assess on-premises websites for migration to Azure App Service. Use Migration Assistant to migrate .NET and PHP web apps to Azure.
- `Azure Data Box`: is a physical device that you can use to transfer large amounts of data to Azure when network transfer is not feasible. It has a capacity of up to 80 TB and can be used for offline data transfer to Azure Storage.
  - Scenarios: 
    -`Disaster recovery` - when a copy of the data from Azure is restored to an on-premises network. In a typical disaster recovery scenario, a large amount of Azure data is exported to a Data Box. Microsoft then ships this Data Box, and the data is restored on your premises in a short time.
    - `Security requirements` - when you need to be able to export data out of Azure due to government or security requirements.
    - `Migrate back to on-premises or to another cloud service provider` - when you want to move all the data back to on-premises, or to another cloud service provider, export data via Data Box to migrate the workloads.

## File movement options
- `AzCopy`: A command-line utility designed for copying data to and from Azure Storage, including within Azure. It supports high-performance data transfer and is ideal for moving large amounts of data efficiently.
- `Azure Storage Explorer`: A graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows you to manage and move data in Azure Storage. It provides an easy-to-use interface for copying, moving, and managing your storage resources.
- `Azure File Sync`: A service that allows you to centralize your file shares in Azure Storage while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. It enables you to synchronize files between on-premises servers and Azure Storage, providing a seamless experience for users and applications.
