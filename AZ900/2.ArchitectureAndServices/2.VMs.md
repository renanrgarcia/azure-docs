# Compute and Networking
## VMs
- Virtual Machines (VMs) are scalable computing resources that can run applications and services in the cloud.
  - `Size`(purpose, number of vCPUs, memory)
  - `Storage` (HDD or SSD, local or remote)
  - `Networking` (NICs, IP addresses, network security groups, port configurations)

### Scale VMs
- **Scale sets**: A group of identical, load-balanced VMs that can automatically increase or decrease in number based on demand or a defined schedule.
  - Provide high availability and scalability for applications.
  - Support for both Windows and Linux VMs.
  - Integration with Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway for traffic distribution.

### Availability Options
- **Availability Sets**: A logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide redundancy and availability.
  - `Update Domains`: can be updated or rebooted at the same time. Azure ensures that VMs in different update domains are not updated simultaneously, providing higher availability during maintenance.
  - `Fault Domains`: share a common power source and network switch. Azure ensures that VMs in different fault domains are not affected by the same hardware failure, providing higher availability.

### VM Sizes
- Azure offers a variety of VM sizes to accommodate different workloads and performance requirements.
  - **General-purpose VMs**: Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio for a wide range of applications.
    - Examples: `B-series`, `D-series`, `A-series`.
  - **Compute-optimized VMs**: High CPU-to-memory ratio for compute-intensive workloads.
    - Examples: `F-series`, `H-series`.
  - **Memory-optimized VMs**: High memory-to-CPU ratio for memory-intensive applications.
    - Examples: `E-series`, `M-series`.
  - **Storage-optimized VMs**: High disk throughput and IOPS for data-intensive workloads.
    - Examples: `L-series`.
  - **GPU VMs**: Specialized VMs with GPU capabilities for graphics rendering and machine learning tasks.
    - Examples: `NC-series`, `ND-series`, `NV-series`.

### Usage examples
- `Test and development`
- `Running applications`
- `Extending on-premises infrastructure`
- `Disaster recovery`
- `High-performance computing`

## Azure Dedicated Host
- Azure Dedicated Host is a service that provides physical servers dedicated to your organization, allowing you to run your VMs on isolated hardware for enhanced security and compliance.

## Azure Spot VMs
- Azure Spot VMs are a cost-effective option for running interruptible workloads. 
- They allow you to take advantage of unused Azure capacity at a discounted price, but they can be evicted when Azure needs the capacity back.

## Reserved Pricing
- Reserved Pricing allows you to save money by committing to a one-year or three-year term for your VMs.
