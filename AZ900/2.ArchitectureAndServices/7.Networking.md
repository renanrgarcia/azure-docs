# Azure Virtual Networking
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. It enables you to securely connect Azure resources to each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- **Capabilities**:
  - `Isolation and segmentation`: VNets provide isolation and segmentation of resources, allowing you to create separate networks for different applications or environments.
  - `Communication`: VNets enable communication between Azure resources, such as virtual machines, and allow you to connect to on-premises networks using VPN or ExpressRoute.
  - `Security`: VNets allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic using network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall, providing enhanced security for your resources.
  - `Integration with Azure services`: VNets can be integrated with various Azure services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure App Service, and Azure SQL Database, to provide secure connectivity and communication.
  - `Route network traffic`: VNets allow you to route network traffic between subnets and to the internet, enabling you to control the flow of traffic and optimize performance.
  - `Filtering network traffic`: VNets enable you to filter network traffic using NSGs, allowing you to define rules that permit or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

## Communication with on-premises networks
- **Point-to-Site VPN**: A secure connection from an individual client computer to an Azure VNet over the internet. It is typically used for remote access scenarios.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: A secure connection between an on-premises network and an Azure VNet over the internet. It is typically used for connecting entire networks together.
- **ExpressRoute**: A private, dedicated connection between an on-premises network and Azure. It provides higher bandwidth and lower latency than VPN connections, making it suitable for mission-critical applications and large data transfers.

### VPN Gateways
- A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure VNet and an on-premises location over the public internet. 
- It is essential for establishing secure VPN connections, such as Point-to-Site and Site-to-Site VPNs, ensuring that data transmitted between the Azure VNet and on-premises networks remains protected from unauthorized access.
  - `Policy-based VPN gateways`: Use static routing and are typically used for simple VPN configurations.
  - `Route-based VPN gateways`: Use dynamic routing and are more flexible, supporting a wider range of VPN configurations and scenarios, including support for multiple tunnels and dynamic routing protocols.

### High-availability options for VPN gateways
- **Active-active configuration**: In this configuration, two VPN gateways are deployed in an active-active mode, allowing for load balancing and failover. If one gateway fails, the other can continue to handle traffic without interruption.
- **Active-passive configuration**: In this configuration, one VPN gateway is active while the other is passive. If the active gateway fails, the passive gateway can take over, but there may be a brief interruption in service during the failover process.
- **ExpressRoute failover**: For ExpressRoute connections, you can configure failover to a secondary ExpressRoute circuit or to a VPN gateway in case of a failure in the primary connection, ensuring continuous connectivity between your on-premises network and Azure.
- **Zone-redundant VPN gateways**: Deploying multiple VPN gateways in different regions or availability zones can provide additional redundancy and high availability for your VPN connections, ensuring that your network remains resilient to failures and outages.

## Subnets
- Subnets are subdivisions of a VNet that allow you to segment your network into smaller, more manageable sections. Each subnet can have its own network security group (NSG) and route table, providing granular control over traffic flow and security.

## Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- NSGs are a critical component of Azure Virtual Networking that allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from Azure resources. They consist of a set of security rules that define the allowed or denied traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

## Application Security Groups (ASGs)
- ASGs are a feature of Azure Virtual Networking that allow you to group together Azure resources based on their security requirements. They provide a way to manage and apply security rules to a group of resources, rather than managing rules for each individual resource.
- ASGs can be used in conjunction with NSGs to simplify the management of security rules and provide a more flexible and scalable approach to securing your Azure resources.

## ExpressRoute
- ExpressRoute is a private, dedicated connection between an on-premises network and Azure. It provides higher bandwidth and lower latency than VPN connections, making it suitable for mission-critical applications and large data transfers. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public internet, providing enhanced security and reliability for your network connectivity.

### Connectivity options for ExpressRoute
- **Point-to-point Ethernet connections**: A direct connection between your on-premises network and Azure using Ethernet, providing high bandwidth and low latency.
- **Any-to-any (IPVPN) networks**: A connection that allows you to connect multiple on-premises locations to Azure using an IPVPN network, providing flexibility and scalability for your network connectivity.
- **Cloud Exchange colocations**: A connection that allows you to connect to Azure through a cloud exchange provider, providing access to Azure from multiple locations and service providers.
- **Directly from ExpressRoute sites**: A connection that allows you to connect directly to Azure from ExpressRoute sites, providing a direct and secure connection to Azure without the need for additional network infrastructure.

## Azure DNS
- Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. It allows you to manage your DNS records and domains in Azure, providing high availability and performance for your applications and services.
- **Benefits**:
  - `Reliability and performance`: Azure DNS is built on a global network of name servers, providing high availability and low latency for DNS queries.
  - `Security`: uses RBAC, activity logs and resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource.
  - `Ease of Use`: Azure DNS provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing your DNS records and domains, making it easy to set up and maintain your DNS infrastructure.
  - `Customizable virtual networks`: Azure DNS allows you to create custom virtual networks for your DNS zones, providing additional isolation and security for your DNS infrastructure.
  - `Alias records`: Azure DNS supports alias records, which allow you to map a DNS name to an Azure resource, such as a load balancer or a storage account, without the need for an IP address. This provides flexibility and simplifies management of your DNS records.

## Azure DNS Zones
- A DNS zone is a container for DNS records that share the same domain name. Azure DNS allows you to create and manage DNS zones in Azure, providing a way to organize and manage your DNS records.
- **Types of DNS zones**:
  - `Public DNS zones`: Used for hosting public-facing DNS records that are accessible over the internet. These zones are typically used for websites, applications, and services that need to be accessible to external users.
  - `Private DNS zones`: Used for hosting internal DNS records that are only accessible within a virtual network or a set of virtual networks. These zones are typically used for internal applications, services, and resources that do not need to be accessible from the internet.

## Azure Traffic Manager
- Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic across multiple Azure regions or endpoints. It provides high availability and responsiveness for your applications by directing user requests to the most appropriate endpoint based on various routing methods.
- **Benefits**:
  - `Global distribution`: Distribute traffic across multiple Azure regions or external endpoints for improved performance and availability.
  - `Customizable routing`: Choose from various routing methods, such as performance, geographic, or priority-based routing, to meet your specific needs.
  - `Health monitoring`: Continuously monitor the health of your endpoints and automatically redirect traffic away from unhealthy instances.
  - `Seamless integration`: Easily integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure CDN and Azure Front Door, for a comprehensive application delivery solution.
