# Core Architecture Components
## Azure Account
- **Description**: An Azure account is required to access Azure services and resources. It provides a unique identity for billing and management.
- Azure free account: can access all Azure services, but there are some limitations:
  - A limited free tier offering access to a subset of Azure services with no charge.
  - 12 months of free access to popular services
  - Credit for additional services for 30 days
  - 25+ always free services
- Azure student account: A special offer for students providing free access to certain Azure services.

## Azure Portal
- https://portal.azure.com

## Cloud Shell
- A browser-based shell experience for managing Azure resources. Could be used as Bash or PowerShell.
- `az <command>`: The Azure CLI command format for managing Azure resources.
- `az interactive`: Launches an interactive shell for Azure CLI commands. There you can explore and execute Azure CLI commands in a guided manner.

## Physical Structure
- Azure data centers are the physical facilities that house the cloud infrastructure.
- **Regions**: Geographic areas that contain one or more data centers, providing redundancy and low-latency access to users.
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate data centers, with independent power, cooling, and networking, within a region, designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Minimum of three Availability Zones per region.
  - Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
    - **Zonal services**: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
    - **Zone-redundant services**: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
    - **Non-regional services**: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
- **Region pairs**: Two Azure regions within the same geographic area that are paired together to provide disaster recovery and high availability. Each region pair is designed to support failover and data replication between the two regions.
- **Sovereign regions**: Azure regions that are physically isolated from other regions and are designed to meet specific regulatory and compliance requirements.
  - U.S. Government has its own dedicated Azure regions to meet strict compliance and security requirements.
  - China also has, and in there the services are operated by a local partner to comply with Chinese regulations.
- **Edge Zones**: Azure Edge Zones extend Azure services to the edge of the network, closer to users and devices, enabling low-latency access and improved performance for edge computing scenarios.

## Azure infrastructure
- **Resource**: A manageable item that is available through Azure. Examples include virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.
- **Resource group**: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It allows for easier management and organization of resources.
  - You can organize resources in a resource group for different environments (development, testing, production) or by department or project.
  - You can manage access, monitor, and apply policies to all resources in a resource group collectively.
- **Subscription**: A logical container for resources that provides a way to manage and organize resources based on billing and access control. Each subscription has its own billing and access management.
  - You can have multiple subscriptions for different purposes, such as separating production and development environments or managing resources for different departments or projects.
  - Subscriptions can be associated with different Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants, allowing for flexible access control and management across organizations.
  - Subscriptions cannot be merged.
- **Management groups**: A higher-level container that can hold multiple subscriptions, allowing for centralized management and governance across those subscriptions. Management groups enable you to apply policies and access controls across multiple subscriptions in a hierarchical manner.
  - There is a single root management group that can contain multiple management groups and subscriptions.
