# Core Architecture Components
## Azure Account
- **Description**: An Azure account is required to access Azure services and resources. It provides a unique identity for billing and management.
- **Components**:
  - **Subscription**: A logical container for Azure resources, allowing for resource management and billing.
  - **Resource Group**: A container for related resources, enabling easier management and organization.
  - **Management Groups**: A way to manage multiple subscriptions, providing a unified view and control.
- Azure free account: A limited free tier offering access to a subset of Azure services with no charge.
  - 12 months of free access to popular services
  - Credit for additional services for 30 days
  - 25+ always free services
- Azure student account: A special offer for students providing free access to certain Azure services.

## Azure Portal
- https://portal.azure.com

## Cloud Shell
- A browser-based shell experience for managing Azure resources. Could be used as Bash or PowerShell.
- `az <command>`: The Azure CLI command format for managing Azure resources.
- `az interactive`: Launches an interactive shell for Azure CLI commands. There you can explore and execute Azure CLI commands in a guided manner.

## Physical Structure
- Azure data centers are the physical facilities that house the cloud infrastructure.
- **Regions**: Geographic areas that contain one or more data centers, providing redundancy and low-latency access to users.
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate data centers, with independent power, cooling, and networking, within a region, designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance. Minimum of three Availability Zones per region.
  - Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
    - **Zonal services**: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
    - **Zone-redundant services**: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
    - **Non-regional services**: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
- **Region pairs**: Two Azure regions within the same geographic area that are paired together to provide disaster recovery and high availability. Each region pair is designed to support failover and data replication between the two regions.
- **Sovereign regions**: Azure regions that are physically isolated from other regions and are designed to meet specific regulatory and compliance requirements.
  - U.S. Government has its own dedicated Azure regions to meet strict compliance and security requirements.
  - China also has, and in there the services are operated by a local partner to comply with Chinese regulations.
- **Edge Zones**: Azure Edge Zones extend Azure services to the edge of the network, closer to users and devices, enabling low-latency access and improved performance for edge computing scenarios.
